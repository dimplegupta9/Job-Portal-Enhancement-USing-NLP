# Job-Portal-Enhancement-USing-NLP
This Repository is made for a NLP project for Job Portal Enhancement. USING BERT AND RESUME SCORING, WE CAN IMPROVE THE JOB PORTAL EXPERIENCE FOR BOTH EMPLOYERS AND JOB SEEKERS. IT CAN HELP EMPLOYERS QUICKLY IDENTIFY THE BEST CANDIDATES FOR A JOB POSITION. FOR JOB SEEKERS, IT CAN HELP THEM CREATE BETTER RESUMES THAT ARE TAILORED TO THE JOB THEY ARE APPLYING FOR. IT CAN ALSO HELP THEM IDENTIFY DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THEIR RESUMES AND THE JOB DESCRIPTION, SO THEY CAN MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES.
## BERT'S Resume Classiffication:

Identifies the applicant's field of expertise. Examples include marketing, HR, and data scientists. Also, we have added a summarizer which gives an overview of the resume.

## Resume Scoring and Strength:

We determine the resume's level using BERTâ€”entry-level, senior-level, or medium-level. Provide a rating from 1-10 indicating the resume's strength and suggestions for how to make it stronger.

## Graphical Representation:

Analysis of a resume based on word frequency and Profile/Technology decomposition using Bar graphs and Pie charts respectively.
